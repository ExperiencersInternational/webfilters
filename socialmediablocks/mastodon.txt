! Title: Mastodon block list
! Description: Blocks a variety of Mastodon servers (including those running on forks such as glitch-soc) since a lot of places do a bad job at it. Uses formatting that AdGuard uses for their lists. I don't expect anyone to actually use it, but if anyone really has a need to block Mastodon (which I'd love to hear), this can be more useful than other filters. Please note that this may block other services hosted on the specified domains, for example mstdn.social hosts a YouTube download service which will get blocked due to using a ^.
