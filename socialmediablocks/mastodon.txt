! Title: Mastodon block list
! Description: Blocks a variety of Mastodon servers (including those running on forks such as glitch-soc) since a lot of places do a bad job at it. Uses formatting that AdGuard uses for their lists. I don't expect anyone to actually use it, but if anyone really has a need to block Mastodon (which I'd love to hear), this can be more useful than other filters.
