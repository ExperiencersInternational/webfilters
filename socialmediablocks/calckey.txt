! Title: Calckey block list

! Description: Blocks a variety of Calckey servers. Uses formatting that AdGuard uses for their lists. I don't expect anyone to actually use it, but if anyone really has a need to block Calckey (which I'd love to hear), this can be more useful than other filters. Please note that this may block other services hosted on the specified domains.
